# STEDI Ecosystem

You work for the data science team at STEDI, a small startup focused on assessing balance for seniors. STEDI has an application that collects data from seniors during a small exercise. The user logs in, and then selects the customer they are working with. Then the user starts a timer, and clicks a button with each step the senior takes. When the senior has reached 30 steps, their test is finished. The data transmitted enables the application to monitor seniorsâ€™ balance risk. 

- Start the STEDI Application

- Log in to the STEDI application

- Click Create New Customer, create a test customer and submit

- Click start, then add steps until you reach 30 and the timer has stopped

- Repeat this three times, and you will receive a risk score
